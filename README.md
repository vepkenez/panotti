# Much of this code originally came from  [audio-classifier-keras-cnn](https://github.com/drscotthawley/audio-classifier-keras-cnn) repo (which is a hack of **@keunwoochoi**'s compact_cnn code).  Difference with Panotti is, it has been generalized beyond mono audio, to include stereo or even more "channels."  And it's undergone many refinements.

To use it:

```
git clone this repo
cd to the top
virtualenv env
(windows) env/Scripts/activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
